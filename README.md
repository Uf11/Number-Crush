# Number Crush Game - Assembly (8086) Version
============================================

### Overview
---------
Number Crush is a puzzle game implemented in Assembly language (8086) for the DOS operating system. The game is inspired by Candy Crush and features a grid of numbers instead of candies. The objective of the game is to match and clear numbers by swapping adjacent numbers in the grid. If a match of more than 3 numbers is found, it is replaced by bomb. And when a bomb is swapped with any character, that character will be removed from the board. The game includes blockers or obstacles placed randomly on the board, which can only be cleared by making specific number combinations in adjacent rows or columns. When a blocker is removed, the numbers from above will fall into empty spaces.

### Prerequisites
--------------
To run the Number Crush game, you need to have DOSBox installed on your system. DOSBox is a DOS emulator that allows you to run DOS applications and games on modern operating systems. You can download DOSBox from the official website (https://www.dosbox.com/) and follow the installation instructions for your specific platform.

### Game Controls
--------------
- Use the mouse cursor to navigate the game board and select numbers.

### Board Size Input
